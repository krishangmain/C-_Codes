scope of variable
in cpp we have block scope
block scope is anything which is written in between curly brraces 
if we have specific variable in the specific blocks it will only be avaliable in those blocks and not outside the block 
for example we have a if block in which we havae a new variable x and we try to access it outside in the main fucntion we cannot
as it wont be avaliable and we will get the error that variable was not declared in the scope 
now if we have a variable declared in the main fucntion and we want to use it in the if we can but if we have the same variable which we have 
initailized again in the if block we will use the new value in the if block ans then once we are out of the if block we will use the old value 
if we have not initailized it agin in the if block and just used it as a noraml variable we will use the value of the one which we have initailized 
in the main fuction itself 
gobal variable one in which we initailized them before the main fucntion such that they can be used at all times 
if we initailise it again in the main fucntion 
that value will be used if we initailise it again in the if looop the new value will be used agagin
if we are to not initailise it again we will be using the new value and the old value will be replaced 
(::) this is known as the scope resolution operator it will acces the global variable no matter which block it is in 
for eg

cout<<""globla a <<::a  so this is the global scope variable 
by this we will be able to get the global value in
